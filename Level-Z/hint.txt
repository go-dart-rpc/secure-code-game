Entities are primarily used to make XML documents more modular, maintainable, and efficient.
Hackers always look for unconventional ways of exploiting a feature.
Especially if that feature (replaceEntities) allows them to retrieve file contents from the server.
The server also appears to behave differently when retrieving files with a specific extension.
Can you trick the server into uploading files with that special extension and then, just maybe, make it dance to the tune of your code?
